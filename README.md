# MNIST-digit-classification
- MNIST is a handwritten Digit Classification dataset that contains 60,000
training and 10,000 test images.
- Built a three-layer feedforward neural networ to classify these digits. Made use of 10K images from the training set as
validation data. The two hidden layers have a dimension of 500 each. 
- Using a suitable loss function, network has been trained for 250 epochs, and classification accuracy has been plotted.
### The above experiment has been repeated, but trained the network with the following regularizations:
- l2 regularization
- Dropout
- Early stopping
